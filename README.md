### Technologies Used:
Pinecone: Fast similarity search for vectorized data.
Language Model (LLM): Harness the power of generative AI for dynamic learning.
LORA Model: Generates the 3-d VR solution
Web Scraper: Gather comprehensive data on circular economy principles.
Semantic Classifier: Discern semantic meanings for effective idea categorization.
Semantic Summarizer: Summuraize content based on its meaning
Nextjs, TailWindCSS: The backbone technologies ensuring a seamless user experience.
Flask: Handles backend and endpoint creations, and runs the ML models

### Retrieval-Augment-Generator (RAG):
EcoLoop's intelligence is amplified by the Retrieval-Augment-Generator framework LangChain, creating a synergy between the Language Model and the vast knowledge repository encoded in the vector database. This ensures that EcoLoop evolves dynamically with every interaction, delivering nuanced and context-aware responses.
